		Bruce Wayne is the owner and CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and is the secret identity of Batman.
		When he was just a kid, he witnessed the murder of his parents in front of his eyes. He had nothing but his butler,
		Alfred Pennyworth. After that event,
		he promised himself that he would never be that powerless person. Thus, this case has altered his
		life completely, and he has become something else. He has trained himself to physical and intellectual
		perfection for years and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Besides, Alfred
	    always stood by him within that period.

		</pre>
		<p>
		Although Batman possesses no super-human powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest
		fighters. He knows almost all martial arts, is an expert on each of them. He makes use of detective
		skills, science and technology, wealth, and intimidation in his war
		crime. He is also a member of the Justice League. Actually,he always would rather to work alone.
		However, sometimes, there can be some circumstances that Batman cannot handle by himself, and most
		of the time, he also helped the league. Even tough he is not seen in the league so much, he is a
		crucial member. He always helps them when they need.
		</p>
		<p>
		Batman has various skills, and especially is known for a character who always is prepared for everything.
		There is even a famous quote for this. It is <i>"Batman always wins if he is prepared."</i>. He calculates
		all the possibilities, and he always has an escape plan for every circumctances. Speaking of
		Batman's preparing, I should mention about his equipments. Bat-suit is his vital kit, and is composed
		of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bullet-proof and resistant to most form of attack.
		His cape is extraordinaril light, and he uses it to glide long distances. His cowl protects his face
		from identification via x-rays.

		Batman's second important equipment is his utility belt. He keeps most of his tools there. It contains
		things below.
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>plastic explosives</li>
				<li>nerve toxins</li>
				<li>batarangs</li>
				<li>smoke bombs</li>
				<li>a fingerprint kit</li>
				<li>a cutting tool</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
		Batman uses vehicles such as Batmobile, Batplane, Batboat, Batcycle in his fights. Each of them is armored
		and sheltered well. As I mentioned before, he makes preparations every time. He chooses proper equipments
		before he goes somewhere, and always has a plan for every situation. That is why he is the best and always
		wins.
