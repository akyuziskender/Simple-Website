		The <em>Justice League</em>, also known as <em>Justice League of America</em>
		<abbr title="Justice League of America">(JLO)</abbr>,
		is a team which fights crime and protects the universe for justice,
		and it is a fictional team of <em>DC Comics, Ink.</em>,
		one of the most two well-known companies in the USA.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:left">
		It was created by <em>Gardner Fox</em>, and it was appeared in
		<em>The Brave and The Bold</em> comic book in 1955 first-time.
		There were some different characters at the beginning, and the original Justice League members was seen
		in The Brave and The Bold #28 against the non-human starfish-like alien, <em>Starro the Conquerer</em> for the first time.
		Eventually, its popularity have increased, and it has become one of
		the most popular comic books in our day. I think we should check out the reasons why people are so interested in it.
		</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>It contains some messages such as justice, unity, helpfulness, equality. In order to teach this terms to children, it is quite good way to encourage
		    them to read comicbooks, specially the Justice League.</li>
		    <li>The idea of seeing more than one superhero just in one comic book attracts children or young ones so much. Because there is a lot of character, everyone
		    can find at least a superhero which he likes.</li>
		    <li>Their relationsip and interactions are always attractive topics. There is more chance to see them together in these kind of comicbooks. Thus, people can learn about their
		    characteristics more easily.</li>
		</ol>

		<p style="text-align: center"><cite>Some essential members of the Justice League</cite></p>
		</div>

		<p> There are seven original members of the league. </p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="superman.html">Superman</a></li>
			<li><a href="batman.html">Batman</a></li>
			<li>Wonder Woman</li>
			<li>Flash</li>
			<li>Martian Manhunter</li>
			<li>Green Lantern</li>
			<li>Aquaman</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Each one of them has various abilities and features,
		and some of them are not even a human.
		Moreover, the number of members in the league has not always remained the same.
		Many other superhero characters such as Cyborg, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, the Atom, Shazam have been seen
		in the league in other comic books. Though Superman is the leader of the Justice League,
		Martian Manhunter performs operations. Therefore, we can say that
		he is the coordinator of the league.
		</p>
		<p>
		Their goals are to protect every species not only on earth but also in the universe, and
		they do everything they can to manage that even if they must die in the end.
		In addition, the villians who they have faced are not easy to defeat. That is why they are in the loop.
        Besides, they have quite dangerous enemies such as <em>Lex Luthor</em>, <em>Joker</em>, <em>Penguin</em>.

		<p> Actually, their first headquarter was the <em>Secret Sanctuary</em> placed in the caverns of Mount Justice.
		However, this situation has changed with help of baron Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman. They were able to
		install new bases thanks to Batman.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Justice League has a base even in space, <em>Watchtower</em>. It is actually a satellite above the Earth,
		and it is said that it is the League's official headquarters. It was built by Batman, and it has state-of-the-art technology. Hence, it enables
		them to control all universe. They also used a headquarter on Earth, <em>Hall of Justice</em>.Firstly, It
		was in Gotham City, but later relocated to Metropolis. These are just outstanding ones. There are other
		headquarters such as The <em>Refuge</em>, <em>JLI Embassies</em>, and <em>Deltroit Bunker</em>.
		</p>
		<pre>
"Gathered together from the cosmic reaches of the universe
– here in this great Hall of Justice - are
the most powerful forces of good ever assembled."

		<p>
		    Since the <em>Justice League</em> is super popular in the last few decades, <em>DC Comics, Ink.</em> has realesed
		    not only comicbooks but also movies and tv series. First of all, a tv series which name is Justice League was
		    produced <em>Warner Bros. Animation</em>, and ran from 2001 to 2004. Though Aquaman is not in the League in this tv series,
		    there is a new creator member, Hawkgirl. They use Watchtower as a headquarter. It lasted two season, 52 episodes, and it was
		    rather succesful. It has gotten so credit. After two season, it continued as Justice League Unlimited. It lasted 3 seasons,
		    39 episodes, and ran from 2004 to 2006. Unlike Justice League (2001-2004), a lot of members which are more than 50 joined the League.
		    Of course, all of them are not seen in the episodes at the same time. Martian Manhunter, the coordinator, sends a group of them to a
		    mission in each episode. Thanks to that, we can explore character of each member very well.
		</p>
		<p>
            As we all know, <em>DC Comics, Ink.</em> has been creating a cinematic universe just like Marvel did. Firstly, the company released <em>Man
            of Steel</em>, and continued with <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, and <em>Suicide Squad</em>. Besides, there will be other movies
            in the future, and one of them is the Justice League: Part One. Its release date is on November 17, 2017, and its director is Zack Synder.
            Wel all look forward to watch it, and I hope it will be a good movie. If you have not watched its trailer yet, you can watch it from below.
